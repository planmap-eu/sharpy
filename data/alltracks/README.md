this shapefile contains linestring items for each line of acquisition obtained by sharad. Each linestring is *simplified* such that the vertices do NOT correspond to the points of acquisition of a sharad pulse. This file was generated by using the notebook:

GenerateAllTracksDB.ipynb

which, in turns require to have a local copy of all the "geoms" files that will be processed which are available here:

[ftp://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mro/mro-m-sharad-5-radargram-v1/mrosh_2001/data/geom/](ftp://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mro/mro-m-sharad-5-radargram-v1/mrosh_2001/data/geom/)

they are ca. 6 Gb of txt files that can be downloaded with something like:

```bash
cd /folder/where/to/put/data
# connect
lfts ftp://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mro/mro-m-sharad-5-radargram-v1/mrosh_2001/data/geom/
# then
mirror -c --use-pget-n=5
# -c allows resume
# or
mirror -c --parallel=5
# also
mirror --only-newer
# to get newer files
```

then they can be injested into a shapefile (or similar) by using the notebook.
